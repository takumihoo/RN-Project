npx create-expo-app .

npm i @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack

After installing react-native-paper, the terminal will show a qr code for you emulator which you may use by installing the Expo Go app in playstore or by using the emulator from Android Studio (need to install first!)

  - If using Android Studio, simply install it and create an empty project.
    - Navigate to the Hamburger icon to Tools -> Device Manager
    - Delete the Virtual Disk and then proceed to creating a new one
    - Navigate to Phone and then select Pixel 4. Next.
    - Select a system image and choose R (download it first!). Next.
    - Run you Device Manager by clicking the play icon

//React Native Basics

To continue, go the App.js file then remove the StatusBar and StyleSheet.

Create a new file named Main.jsx, then type rnfe to start (install the react extension first!).
